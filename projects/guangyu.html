                        <h2>"Branding" a brand designer.</h2>
                    </li>

                        <p>The biggest hurdle of this project was <b>negotiating the diverse and 
                            library of work</b> Guang Yu has done throughout his career with <b>my own personal 
                            style.</b> Something I quickly realized was that a brand designer doesn't 
                            necessarily have a 'personal style', or anything that is distinctly 
                            'them' (at least visually) when working on a project for a client. 
                            I instead had to craft a 
                            style of *presenting* work, that gave enough reverence for the 
                            work itself, while also representing the guile, adaptability, 
                            and creativity of a multi-faceted and practical designer.<br><br>
                            I ended up with a system that reflected the practical nature Guang Yu 
                            uses to present his own work, a system that lets the work speak for 
                            itself. Tight and neat type treatment, clean and energetic motion, 
                            and a constant dedication to <b>representation over reinvention</b> brough this 
                            system of artifacts together, and I am beyond happy with how this turned out.

                            introduces Guang Yu, detailing his work as a symbol for his progression

                        <p>Approaching this project, I thought that in order to have a consistent
                            series of projects, I would have to surmise some clever and 
                            experimental visual style in order to be successful. However, that
                            just wasn't what the project demanded. I instead had to 
                            practice restraint and approach much more conservatively with the 
                            visual elements to <b>accurately capture the practical nature of Guang 
                            Yu's body of work.</b><br><br>
                            Overall, this project has been incredibly rewarding. I truly enjoyed 
                            each and every part, and learned so much about my personal work and 
                            visual style throughout. Please contact me if you would like to learn 
                            more about this project, it means a lot to me and I'm happy to go in
