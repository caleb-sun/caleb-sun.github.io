                        <p>I interned at CSL Behring between May and December of 2023. During that period, I was a part of an
                            internal SCRUM team working on the Plasma Digital Product ecosystem. The SCRUM
                            Team was made up of about 10 members spanning development, management,
                            QA, and design capabilities, and worked within a 2-week sprint structure.<br><br>
                            With them, I made major design and operational improvements, laying the foundation for a more 
                            collaborative, systematic, and creative design practice by building a <a href="#system">functional design system</a> 
                            from scratch, <a href="#ops">re-organizing file structures</a> to improve on cross-functional legibility, and explored

                        <p>When I was onboarded onto the Plasma team, the largest issue that designers were facing was a lack of 
                            documentation, standardization, and flexibility engrained in the existing Plasma design systme. My largest 
                            responsibility with the Plasma team that spanned the entire duration of my internship was to audit and rebuild the 
                            CSL Plasma design system, mostly from scratch.

                        <p>The existing design system documentation was limited, outdated, and inherited from an outsourced agency. The first step
                            in taking on this endeavour was to audit the gaps that our current design system had, from the molecular level. We saw 
                            that even core elements of our system were poorly documented, and decided to start from scratch, going all the way 
                            back to color, type, and spacing.

                        <p>I took the initiative to implement all color decisions made by the art director on our team through 
                            variables, which were a recent development during my internship. This method was highly needed 
                            considering the complex nature of the Plasma app, and also afforded the ability for us to 
                            expand to include different color shifts like dark mode if the need ever arises.<br><br>
                            More importantly, though, by implementing this feature we would build a pathway for implementation 
                            once the dev team caught up.

                        <p>During this process of redefining core components, I proposed a subtle but impactful color shift between 
                            CSL's standard red color and a more accessible red that would meet accessibility guidelines. Small shifts 
                            and adjustments like these were always mocked up to communicate value and impact to business and marketing 
                            stakeholders, so that we could advocate better for our users and start the new system off on the right foot.

                        <p>In order to visualize this problem, I created a concept map visualizing the different points of interaction 
                            within our Figma files, and followed it up with a proposed map that would create dedicated and refined channels 
                            for each functionality to interact with. These graphics were crucial in getting this project off the 
                            ground and communicating my intent with other team members.

                        <p>From there, I created components intended on sitting next to designed screens to help non-designers cross-reference, 
                            navigate, and identify designs. These components also integrated Jira in a custom solution that plugins were unable

                        <p>A part of the weekly tasks I was responsible for in the SCRUM team was to reconsider the architecture, 
                            usability, and visual appearance of key flows in the donor experience.<br><br>
                            This effort would ideally exist and be implemented in conjunction with an extensive design system update, but 
                            since that wasn't feasible given our limited resources, this task was heavily influenced by the need to balance 
                            what the design team *wanted* and what the business and dev team would be able to carry out.

                        <p>I began by conducting an audit of the Plasma app, looking for key flows or screens in the donor experience

                            key flows would serve as a reference point in a proposed total refresh of CSL Plasma's brand identity, and 
                            how that identity would impact a donor's journey.

                        <p>The nearly full year that I spent at CSL included some of the most amazing and productive projects 
                            I've ever taken on, both on an individual and group context. I thouroughly enjoyed ever aspect of 
                            the work, even including grappling over atomic-level color shifts. <br><br> 
                            I would like to thank Andrea Noll, my manager, who trusted me to take on these large-scale projects. 
                            Her patience and encouragement really allowed for my passions for system design and operations to 
                            flourish, and her passion for advocacy for her users inspiired me to really pursue impactful design, 
                            within any organization.<br><br>
                            While my time at CSL has ended, I've learned a lot and am proud of the work that I was able to complete. 
                            Designing good ways to design take time, and while my passion in this sector is strong, I am hungry for 
                            a space that will allow me to learn more about the frameworks and tools that can allow for design and 
                            development to flourish.
