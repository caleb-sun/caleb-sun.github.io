        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">Having transitioned recently to an in-house design team, CSL Plasma's design operations were impeded by disorganization and having to collaborate with a multidisciplinary SCRUM team. <br><br>Through a series of workshops, interviews, and external research, I lead an initiative to introduce an organization structure to CSL Plasma's design files that balances the needs of different types of stakeholders, as well as opening the ability to scale up in the future. This effort has since been adopted by the team to great enthusiasm, having aligned the workflows of different contributors in an elegant and non-intrusive way.</p>
        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">The Plasma team works with SCRUM and Agile methodologies, meaning work happens within a 2-week sprint cycle in the form of small, manageable tasks. The team uses a software called Jira to track and measure progress in these sprints, and designers cross-link to a master Figma file to log their progress. In the master Figma file, each page corresponds to a sprint task, and are titled after the sprint number. This poses a challenge to developers and business stakeholders on the team, who are unable to quickly find the status or purpose of a designed flow.</p>
        <span class="hugebr"></span>

          />
          <span class="hugebr"></span> 
          <p class="text">Imagine you’re keeping a journal that you update every day. Your journal is an excellent chronological archive of your writing, but if an outsider were to try to navigate your journal to find the last time you wrote about any given subject, they would have no way to easily navigate to what they’re looking for.</p>
          <p class="bold text">That’s the primary downside of the way we were using Figma; our designers were logging work in a way that was not useful to anyone on the team.
          <br><br><p class="text">I was not tasked with this effort, and instead initiated it on my own given my interest around team work dynamics. I also am a bit of an organization buff, which helped. There was a clear business incentive to this project, as the disorganization–while tolerable–resulted in a lot of unnecessary cross-communication. It also created an unwelcoming environment for developers and business team members, as we’ve essentially invited them into our cluttered home and told them to make themselves comfortable. And thus the stage was set.</p>

        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">The first stage of this project was to gather information on how different team members were currently using our Figma files, struggles included. I organized a workshop attended by a project manager, three developers, and two designers, to get their honest input. The workshop was conducted over Figjam and I asked each participant to document the ways they’re currently using our Figma files, what areas they are struggling with, and what their wishes were for our design files in the future.
          <br><br>This workshop was a success, and as my team members had been working with our Figma files since the in-house practice’s inception, they all expressed gratitude towards the effort. My understanding is that at the start of using Figma and Jira, the sprint-based organization was serviceable, but the team has since outgrown it. This reinforced the goal of scalability for the reorganization effort. CSL Plasma has three in-house digital products, and we needed to be prepared for more products, more functionalities, and potentially more team members.
          <br><br>A major finding I gleaned from the workshop was the different tasks each team member needed Figma for. This helped me created a concept map of our existing file structure and its use cases, pictured below.</p>
        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <img
            src="current figma concept map"
            alt="A concept map of the existing Figma organization structure."
        />
        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <p class="text">I created an affinity diagram with the remaining feedback from the workshop and identified two major factors limiting our team’s success with Figma: lack of consistent status documentation and poor usage of the left-side navigation. Designers might notice that these factors really only apply within a Figma file, and doesn’t involve the file directory within the Figma workspace. More on that later. With these factors, my own personal experience working on the SCRUM team, and support from designers outside of Plasma, I was able to put a plan in action for how to address this problem space.</p>
        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <h2>Conceptualizing – The Organism</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">If you search Figma File Organization Template, you find a lot of good generic resources that aren’t really tuned to individual team needs. I did this in the first leg of ideation to get a feel for what’s out there, and came across a lot of good but sterile conventions that wouldn’t work for our team. Most of these templates are for short design exercises, one-time design handoffs, and designer-exclusive teams. Notably, these templates were intended to only carry one user flow. Given the iterative, sprint-based, multidisciplinary structure of our SCRUM team, it didn’t make sense to divorce from a “master” design file that contained *all* UI designs, rather than just a couple. </p>

            src="current figma concept map"
            alt="A screenshot of a template Figma file structure."
        />
        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <p class="text">When I set out to reorganize, I created a concept map that quickly illustrated the difference between our old file structure and a better one, pictured below.</p>
        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <img
            src="current figma concept map"
            alt="A concept map of an updated Figma organization structure."
        />
        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <p class="text">Most of these broad stroke changes are intuitively made, like separating different digital products into their own files, organizing designs by categories, and using dev mode (yay Config 2023). More importantly, within a file’s pages, there would be certain “map” style pages designating sections to document different flows’ cross-interactions. Think an Onboarding section including user log-in, password resets, and registration. Below the sections, there would be included flows documented in more detail. This is a unique requirement from the developers, who require both the nitty-gritty details of individual designs, as well as an overview of all interactions in a section of the app when linking things together. Imagine a map at a museum. You need to reference it to get a gist of your surroundings and the interconnected-ness of the exhibits, but you also need to experience the exhibits themselves.</p>

        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">The video portion of this project gave me the most trouble, but I ultimately strayed away from a story-telling narrative style and instead focused on creating a charming sizzle reel, bringing Guang Yu's projects to life.</p>

        <h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">These series of projects really challenged me. Having such a prolific designer and expansive body of work to contend with, I struggled a lot with generating a direction for these artifacts creatively. What was the turning point was me realizing that an expereince can be all that you need to define a 'brand'. What made my projects fit together was the experience of discovering each and every projects, and capturing that sensation that drew me to Guang Yu in the first place was the defining factor of the design system.</p>
