                <p>CSL Plasma's Donor Experiences were designed and developed by external vendors, leading to a lot of missed opportunities and room for improvement. As a part of bi-weekly sprints, I was responsible for identifying areas to redesign, with a priority in improving information architecture, logic of flows, and general look and feel of the app without straying far from the existing app design.<br><br>
                  Throughout my internship, I redesigned around 10 critical flows that were misaligned with both user and business goals, setting the groundwork for future app updates.</p>

                <p>A business goal for CSL's user testing trials was to gauge the mental models and understanding of different in-center processes of users who are unfamiliar with donating at CSL Plasma. I created a generative activity to capture participant understanding of several key donation procedures having completed usability testing steps.<br><br>
                  These testing trials are still underway, but this activity has allowed our dry-run participants to show their understanding clearly while also not bogging them down with too much unnecessary information.</p>

          <h2>Re-Designing for Collaboration</h2>
          <span class="mediumbr"></span>
          <p class="text">Having transitioned recently to an in-house design team, CSL Plasma's design operations were impeded by disorganization and having to collaborate with a multidisciplinary SCRUM team. <br><br>Through a series of workshops and interviews, I lead an initiative to introduce an organization structure to CSL Plasma's design files that balances the needs of different types of stakeholders, as well as opening the ability to scale up in the future. This effort has since been adopted by the team to great enthusiasm, having aligned the workflows of different contributors in an elegant and non-intrusive way.</p>

          <span class="hugebr"></span>
          <p class="text">The workshop I lead at the onset of this project revealed a lot of the pain points in the team's current workflow:</p>
          <span class="largebr"></span>
          <img src="../../images/csl/workshop-feedback.png" alt="Front and back cover of a magazine with different packaging design samples."/>
          <span class="hugebr"></span>
          <p class="text">The core of the re-organization effort lies in the introduction of grouping and labeling components used to indicate key information that assists team members in their respective workflows. Upkeep is simple on the designer's end, and results in much less time spent cross-communicating on issues long since resolved.</p>
