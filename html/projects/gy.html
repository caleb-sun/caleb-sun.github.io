      <div> <p class="text">Guang Yu is a Beijing-based graphic designer, and co-creative director of A Black Cover Design studio. He is my design hero because he represents what I idolize in the modern designer: adaptability, humility, and an eye for detail.</p>
        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <h2>Poster</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">The poster is supposed to be a "first-impression" of Guang Yu, and I decided to represent his work in the way that I had initially found it, with all the intricately crafted artifacts laid out on a sparse website. This method of discovering Guang Yu's work that I developed in the first piece reappears in all the different artifacts.</p>

        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <h2>Booklet</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">The booklet is a deeper dive into Guang Yu's story. I approached the project conservatively in the design, in order to pack in as much information as possible.</p>
        <span class="hugebr"></span>

        <span class="hugebr"></span>
        <h2>Digital Experience</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">The digital kiosk experience allowed me to practice some UX thinking. I had to take into careful consideration the different affordances for a large touchscreen that people interact with at vastly different levels than that of a smartphone. The motif of discovery in a mass of thumbnails reoccurs prominantly here, as well as careful consideration to motion.</p>

        <h2>Motion</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">The video portion of this project gave me the most trouble, but I ultimately strayed away from a story-telling narrative style and instead focused on creating a charming sizzle reel, bringing Guang Yu's projects to life.</p>

        <h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
        <span class="largebr"></span>
        <p class="text">These series of projects really challenged me. Having such a prolific designer and expansive body of work to contend with, I struggled a lot with generating a direction for these artifacts creatively. What was the turning point was me realizing that an expereince can be all that you need to define a 'brand'. What made my projects fit together was the experience of discovering each and every projects, and capturing that sensation that drew me to Guang Yu in the first place was the defining factor of the design system.</p>
