          <p class="descriptor-head">A new type of donation</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>CSL has always conducted plasma donations on a walk-in basis. However, there was a
             push from business stakeholders to introduce an appointment scheduling capability 
             to their locations. As the only touchpoint between CSL and plasma donors outside
             physical centers, the Plasma app was leveraged as the medium to introduce this
             functionality.<br><br>
             Having already designed baseline screens for the new flow, there was a push to test
             and improve before production caught up, so that the transition from walk-in to appointment
             would be as smooth as possible.

          <p>Through two rounds of testing, we were able to identify areas to improve the existing
            designs, areas to put back to the drawing board, and areas to scrap completely. We also
            established protocol for future trials and, more importantly, validated the importance 
            of user input during the design process.

          <p class="descriptor-head">Is the existing user journey seamless and easy to understand?</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>Another designer had collaborated closely with business stakeholders to create a 
            user-appointment journey, but given the differences between CSL and other healthcare 
            apps, we needed to evaluate whether the deviations in the app from traditional user
            mental models would impede its usage.</p>
          <span class="largebr"></span>
          <p class="descriptor-head">How can we evaluate participant mental models around plasma donation?</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>A goal of the entire CSL Plasma app is to educate and inform new donors about what to
            expect when donating plasma. When creating this flow, we needed to ensure that
            users could learn and be prepared for their appointment, and a challenge for the project
            was to come up with an effective way to evaluate users for their understanding through
            both questions and generative activities.</p>
          <span class="largebr"></span>
          <p class="descriptor-head">How can we facilitate usability testing in a remote environment?</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>Considering that this was the first usability testing trials conducted by CSL in-house ever,
            a challenge for this project was to establish best practices and procedure with no 
            previously-established protocol. This included preparing technology set-up guides, detailed
            documentation, and robust tester-friendly prototypes.

          <p>I created a visual guide for technology set-up for participants to reference as they
            prepared for their testing session, keeping in mind that participants may have varying

          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>I created a fully-functional Figma prototype to allow for realistic
            testing, taking advantage of local variables to simulate live data. The decision to use
            a Figma prototype as opposed to a production prototype was based on the difficulty of
            facilitating screen-sharing remotely. To empower economically diverse participants, we
            prioritized universiality in the testing methodologies.
