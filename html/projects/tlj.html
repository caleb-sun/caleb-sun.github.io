          <h3>Overview</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Tous les Jours Dublin was a franchised store in my community that I worked at in high school. While there, I quickly noticed that there was a gap in the way the business was handling cake orders, and the customer expectations. The lack of unity, security, and reliability of the ordering system was causing customer distrust and confusion among staff, given how quickly the location had grown since its inception.</p>
          <span class="mediumbr"></span>
          <p>This project was self-initated as a challenge to see how I could address this problem space. In high school, I had created a <u><a href="https://www.tlj-dublin.com/" target="_blank">Wix site</a></u> for the bakery so that they could have a digital catalog and ordering site, but I knew that a website was only a bandaid to a bigger problem. My challenge for myself this time around was to create digital products that facilitated better business practices, not just the format of cake ordering on its own.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p style="font-weight: 800;">Messy Ordering System</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>Tous les Jours Dublin was completely dependent on a paper-based order tracking system for their cakes. This led to lost order slips, customer confusion, and overall pandamonium especially during busy seasons.</p>
          <span class="largebr"></span>
          <p style="font-weight: 800;">High Customer Expectations</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>Customer expectations were progressing based on industry standards of mobile ordering, and the bigger the gap between Tous les Jours and other companies that existed, the more antequated Tous les Jours seemed to the modern customer.</p>
          <span class="largebr"></span>
          <p style="font-weight: 800;">Security and Verification</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>This is a problem closely tied to the analog ordering system, but customers had no way of proving their identity when picking up cakes, or accessing an order confirmation to verify that their cake was being made.</p>

          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p style="font-weight: 800;">Knowing the System is Subjective</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>I thought that by working at TLJ, I understood the cake ordering process. By creating a product based off of this knowledge, I was quickly made aware of the gaps in my knowledge. I know now that if I were to create products for actual clients, I would need to focus a lot more time and attention to the discovery/onboarding phase.</p>
          <span class="largebr"></span>
          <p style="font-weight: 800;">Time Allocation for Deliverables</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>When working on a project of this scale with this limited timeframe, I sure did waste a lot of hours working on a payment flow that didn't necessarily demonstrate anything that helps in my final deliverables. In the future, I know to allocate time better towards delivering actual useful flows, instead of just the ones that are technically interesting to me.</p>
          <span class="largebr"></span>
          <p style="font-weight: 800;">Concept Diagramming is So Useful</p>
          <span class="smallbr"></span>
          <p>My earlier diagramming helped streamline the design process so much. It's definitely a practice that I have taken for granted, but not anymore.</p>
